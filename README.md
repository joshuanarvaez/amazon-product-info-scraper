Project: Product Info Scraper

Description: 
Here we create our own API or backend application. We use NodeJS for runtime and Express which is a framemwork for node that allows us to create a server. We will then deploy it on Heroku and host it on RapidAPI's marketplace. We use ScraperAPI which allows you to scrape HTML from any website and turn it into useful JSON information.

Dependencies: npm install express request-promise nodemon request

Tools: NodeJS, Express, ScraperAPI, Heroku, RapidAPI
